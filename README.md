# Random User Pagination

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This project, "randomUser-pagination", is a solution to the assessment interview on YouTube titled "Beginner React.js Coding Interview (ft. Cl√©ment Mihailescu)". You can watch the interview [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnkrDse9QKc&t=1606s).

## Project Description

The application fetches data from the Random User API and displays a user's first and last name along with their thumbnail. It also implements a pagination system where each user is assigned a unique page number. Users can navigate through the pages using the "Load next user" and "Load previous user" buttons.
